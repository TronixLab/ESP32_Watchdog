# MCU (ESP32) Lockup Detection Using Internal WatchDog
## I. Introduction
If your program gets stuck for some reason, the fastest way to recover is to restart your computer. One of the most common examples was when the Windows operating system would crash (experience a fatal error) and display the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), after which the machine would reboot to avoid further damage. Unlike desktop computers, embedded devices must be self-reliant. What if you are unable to restart the computer physically? If the program hangs, it's not always possible to wait for anyone to reset them. Some embedded designs, such as space probes, are simply inaccessible to humans, and a manual reset is not feasible; these could become permanently disabled if they were unable to autonomously recover from faults. In such situations, a human operator's capacity to reset the device will be inadequate to satisfy the product's uptime requirements. As firmware engineers, it is our responsibility to ensure that our devices can always recover from a stuck task or infinite loop. A watchdog is the only way usually employed in cases like these [[1](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/whats-watch-dog-timer-wdt-faq/)], [[2](https://www.embedded.com/introduction-to-watchdog-timers/)]. Watchdog is typically used in embedded systems and other computer-controlled equipment where humans cannot easily access the equipment or would be unable to respond to faults promptly [[3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295010877_Architecture_and_Operation_of_a_Watchdog_Timer)].
